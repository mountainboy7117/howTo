<h6>I find that this buffalo chicken dip is the perfect thing to have at a party of a family gathering. It taste super good and is fast to make. 
    Plus it all gose in one pot that you can bring with you and serve out of. It has a really good consistency and not to much spice. Altho if you like spicy
     things  you can simlpy add extra franks Red Hot but make sure to not add to much because it will overpower the amazing flavors in the dip.</h6></i>
